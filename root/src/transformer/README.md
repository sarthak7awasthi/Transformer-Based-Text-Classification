# Transformer Module (transformer.rs)

A Rust implementation of a Transformer-based architecture for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. This module combines encoder layers with a classification head for tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and sequence labeling.

## Architecture Overview

The module consists of two main components:

### 1. Stacked Encoder Layers

- Processes input sequences using parallel attention mechanisms
- Includes multi-head attention, feed-forward networks, residual connections, and layer normalization
- Captures contextual information and token relationships regardless of distance

### 2. Classification Head

- Aggregates encoder outputs into sequence-level representations
- Maps final embeddings to task-specific output probabilities

## Mathematical Foundation

### Attention Mechanism

The core attention computation follows:

```
Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√dk)V
```

Where:

- Q: Query matrix
- K: Key matrix
- V: Value matrix
- dk: Key dimensionality

### Feed-Forward Network

Each token passes through a two-layer network:

```
FFN(x) = ReLU(xW₁ + b₁)W₂ + b₂
```

### Layer Processing

Each layer combines attention and feed-forward processing with residual connections:

```
Output = LayerNorm(x + SubLayer(x))
```

## Input/Output Specifications

### Input

- Shape: `[batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dim]`
- Contains token embeddings combined with positional encodings

### Output

- Shape: `[batch_size, num_classes]`
- Contains class probabilities for the specified task

## Key Features

- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient token processing compared to sequential architectures
- **Long-range Dependencies**: Captures relationships between distant tokens effectively
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible with additional components or task-specific modifications
- **Stable Training**: Incorporates layer normalization and residual connections

## Forward Pass Process

1. Input embeddings are combined with positional encodings:

   ```
   Ei = Embedding(ti) + PositionalEncoding(i)
   ```

2. Sequences pass through encoder layers:

   ```
   Hl+1 = EncoderLayer(Hl)
   ```

3. Final outputs are pooled and classified:
   ```
   PooledOutput = (1/L) ∑(i=1 to L) Hi(N)
   Logits = Softmax(PooledOutput·W + b)
   ```
