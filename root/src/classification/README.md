# Classification Head Module (classification_head.rs)

A Rust module that serves as the final layer in the Transformer pipeline, mapping high-dimensional encoder outputs to task-specific predictions for various classification tasks like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and text categorization.

## Overview

The `ClassificationHead` module bridges the gap between the Transformer's contextual embeddings and task-specific outputs through two main operations:

1. Pooling encoder outputs into a single sequence representation
2. Transforming the pooled representation into class predictions

## Architecture

### Pooling Layer

Aggregates token-level embeddings into a single sequence representation:

```
P = (1/L) ∑(i=1 to L) hi
```

Where:

- L: Sequence length
- hi: Embedding for the i-th token
- P: Pooled representation

### Dense Layer

Maps the pooled representation to class logits:

```
Logits = P·W + b
Probabilities = Softmax(Logits)
```

Where:

- W: Weight matrix (dmodel × num_classes)
- b: Bias vector (num_classes)

## Input/Output Specifications

### Input

- Shape: `[batch_size, dmodel]`
- Contains pooled encoder outputs (one vector per sequence)

### Output

- Shape: `[batch_size, num_classes]`
- Contains raw logits before softmax activation

## Key Features

- **Dimensionality Reduction**: Efficiently maps high-dimensional encoder outputs to class-specific predictions
- **Task Adaptability**: Easily modified for different classification tasks
- **Generalization**: Robust sequence representation through token pooling
- **Efficiency**: Operates on pooled representations rather than token-level embeddings

## Mathematical Foundation

### Pooling Operation

The module aggregates token embeddings H = [h₁, h₂, ..., hL] into a single representation:

```
H ∈ ℝ^(L × dmodel)  # Token embeddings
P = Average_Pool(H)  # Pooled representation
```

### Classification Transform

The pooled representation is transformed into class probabilities:

```
Softmax(zi) = exp(zi) / ∑j exp(zj)
```
